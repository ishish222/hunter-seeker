1. Choose a sample and record coverage
[see: coverage-tests-procedure.txt, the result is initial coverage]

2. Configure generator & generate 3 mutated samples
python:
import hs
import generators.generator
g = generators.generator.Generator()
import generators.changer
g.mutator = generators.changer.Changer
g.origin_path = "/home/ish/projects/2012-08-02-korrino/samples-generator-tests/prepared/main.swf"
g.dest_path = "/home/ish/projects/2012-08-02-korrino/samples-generator-tests/main.swf-changer-2/"
g.dest_suffix = ".sample"
g.mutations = 2
g.generate(3)

3. Record mutated coverage

4. Repeat steps 2 & 3 several times

5. Choose configuration with best coverage or:

6. Detect and overcome coverage barriers
